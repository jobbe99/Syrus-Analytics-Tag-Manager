Syrus Analytics & Tag Manager

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to integrate simple google analytics service in your wordpress admin-dashboard and tag manager adds a field
to the existing General Settings page for the ID and outputs the javascript in the front-end footer.
Tested in Firefox, Safari, Chrome and IE.

== Installation ==

Just install the plugin from WordPress store and a new entry will appear on your admin dashboard. You can set your own preferences in your admin menÃ¹.
For Google Tag Manager go to `Settings` > `General` and set the ID from your Google Tag Manager account.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why isn't the output displaying? =

Two possibilities: First, you haven't yet specified the ID in the admin panel, or second, your theme is missing a `<?php wp_footer(); ?>` call.
